A week later, Iâ€™m still reeling from the whirlwind experience.</p> <p>I feel so incredibly lucky for all the amazing people Iâ€™ve met and worked with while organisingÂ Mixin.</p> <p>The incredible team â€” Kylie, Patima, Mandy, Phuong, Josh, Meagan â€” all so talented and hard working. Pulling off Mixin 2016 with them has been the highlight of my career so far.</p> <p>The incredible speakers, who brought the energy and spirit to Mixin. Andy, Una, Alice, Joel, Jina, Mike and Espen â€” thank you for visiting and sharing your wisdom and experience, I know you all truly made Mixin 2016 unforgettable for us organisers.</p> <p>And off course, our wonderful audience. Thank you all so very much for making Mixin a reality.</p> <p>In the lead up, <a target="_blank" href="http://mixinconf.com/blog/2016/09/01/speakers-us-and-most-of-all-you/">I mused about</a> the need for a conference like Mixin in Perth. It was a lot of hard work, but the reception from you made it so very worthwhile, and validates the need for a conference of this calibre in Perth.</p> <p>Whatever the future holds, Perth deserves more conferences like Mixin.</p> </div> </div> </div> <div class='PhotoRow'> <div class='PhotoCol_alpha'><img alt="Be Open" src="/images/blog/2016-11-05-be-open/kylie_and_josh.jpg"/></div> <div class='PhotoCol_beta'> <img alt="Crowd" src="/images/blog/2016-11-05-be-open/crowd.jpg"/> <img alt="The Mixin team and crowd" src="/images/blog/2016-11-05-be-open/organisers.jpg"/> </div> </div> <div class='Content_row'> <div class='Content_main'> <div class='Article_content'> <p>It wasnâ€™t until Mixin was over and I found myself full to the brim with motivation and inspiration that I recognised that I had been in a rut â€” and I hadnâ€™t even realised â€” until Mixin.</p> <h2 id="saying-yes">Saying â€˜yesâ€™</h2> <p>Itâ€™s hard for me to believe I ever agreed to take part in Mixin. It was the inspiration from conference experiences at <a target="_blank" href="https://www.webdirections.org/events/">Web Directions</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://2016.cssconf.com.au/">CSSConf</a> that encouraged us to take the leap of faith necessary to organise Mixin, and I donâ€™t think I ever actually stopped to consider <em>all</em> the risks.</p> <p>This is unusual for me â€” Iâ€™ve always been a little reserved putting myself out there. But seeing what happens when youâ€™re surrounded by such talented and wonderful people, and what can be accomplished together. The reward made the risks completely worthwhile.</p> <h2 id="being-open">Being open</h2> <p>I know imposter syndrome and anxiety is rampant in our industry.</p> <p>As long as I can remember, Iâ€™ve always been very nervous about putting my work and ideas out there â€” that critical voice in my head making me fearful about what others will say. But the more I reflect on my actual experiences in the industry, the more I realise how irrational and limiting this fear is.</p> <p>During her awesome talk on the joys of image optimisation, <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/una">Una</a> turned her attention to our very own <a target="_blank" href="http://mixinconf.com/">Mixin website</a> â€” which I had a bit of a hand in building â€” and proceeded to dissect it on stage and show the ways it could be improved.</p> <p>We knew this was coming. Una asked us for a copy of the website, and we (especially me) nervously wondered what kind of scrutiny it would come under during her talk.</p> <p>But when our site came up on screen in front of 250 people, and Una began to run through the myriad of ways to improve it, I couldnâ€™t stop smiling.</p> <p><em>This</em> was what I was nervous about? <em>This</em> was why I didnâ€™t like to put my work and myself out there?</p> <h2 id="this-was-wonderful">This was wonderful</h2> <p>Putting yourself out there can feel risky, but it isnâ€™t. Nobody Iâ€™ve met is harsher than we are on ourselves, and we can only learn and grow by sharing what we know with others.</p> <p>Everyone Iâ€™ve personally met in the industry is so positive. We can take pride in our work while recognising thereâ€™s always room to improve, and being open to learning. To that end, the enthusiasm and tone of Unaâ€™s talk was pitch perfect for me!</p> <p>Itâ€™s important to remember, as <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/byalicelee">Alice</a> reminded us, that everyoneâ€™s at a different place in their careers, weâ€™ve just got to be aware of pencil mileage. Embracing what you know, but also what you donâ€™t, is key to learning.</p> <p>Or, as fellow organiser Mandy Michael put it â€” <a target="_blank" href="http://mandymichael.com/articles/the-only-bad-question-is-the-one-you-didnt-ask.html">the only bad question is the one you didnâ€™t ask</a>.</p> <h2 id="going-forward">Going forward</h2> <p>The Monday following Mixin, Patima asked if I would be able to speak that Wednesday at <a target="_blank" href="https://www.meetup.com/Port80-Perth/events/235232980/">Port80 Perth</a>. Prior to Mixin, I probably would have declined, but still riding that high from Mixin, I jumped at the chance, and later found myself awake at 4am that Wednesday eagerly preparing my slides. Iâ€™d accidentally found what kept me awake until the early hours of the morning, something Joel suggested people do during his talk on Full Stack Anxiety.</p> <p>And I canâ€™t wait to do it again.</p> <p>Iâ€™m committed to sharing what I know. <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/BrettJay/brett.cool">The source code for brett.cool is public</a>. My kludgey Sass and my hacky haml is visible for everyone to scrutinise, pull apart, learn from, suggest improvements to, steal, criticise.</p> <p>I welcome it all. <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/BrettJay/brett.cool/issues/new">For reals</a>.
